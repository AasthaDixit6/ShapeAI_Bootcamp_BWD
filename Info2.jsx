        This bootcamp upskilled me in extracting information from a raw data and
        use them according to one's interest. The data so obtained can thus be
        operated on by various tools and techniques for further analysis. The
        instructor Dipayan Ghoshal was very good and easy going and made concept
        understanding sessions very interesting and easy!
