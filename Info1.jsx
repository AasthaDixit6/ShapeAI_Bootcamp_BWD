        It has been an amazing bootcamp where I came to know how a website is
        developed out of my curiosity. How html, css and javasript are utilised
        simultaneously to provide a website that is attractive to scroll and
        search. Also the instructor Shaurya Sinha is very good and easy going
        and made understand the concepts from scratch very enthusiastically!
